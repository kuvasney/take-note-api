# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem
The deployment was successful but returned 404 because Vercel couldn't find the correct entry point.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
- Changed entry point to use `api/server.ts` (Vercel convention)
- Simplified routing configuration

### 2. Created `api/server.ts`
- Entry point for Vercel that imports the main server
- Follows Vercel's preferred structure

### 3. Modified `src/server.ts`
- Added conditional server start (only starts in non-production/non-Vercel environments)
- Added root endpoint (`/`) for better Vercel compatibility
- Maintains MongoDB connection for serverless functions

### 4. Added Root Endpoint
- `GET /` now returns API information
- Helps with Vercel's routing and health checks

## Environment Variables for Vercel
Make sure these are set in your Vercel dashboard:

```
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app
```

## Testing
After deployment, you should be able to access:
- `https://take-note-api-five.vercel.app/` - Root endpoint
- `https://take-note-api-five.vercel.app/health` - Health check
- `https://take-note-api-five.vercel.app/api/notes` - Notes API

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy
3. Test the endpoints above
